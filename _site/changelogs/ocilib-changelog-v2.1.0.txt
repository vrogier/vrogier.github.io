2008-03-04 Version 2.1.0 Vincent Rogier vince_rogier@yahoo.fr

    * Added public retrieval of internal OCI handles :

      - See new section in the documentation (page <module>, section <Using OCI Handles directly>)
      - OCI_HandleGetEnvironment()
      - OCI_HandleGetContext()
      - OCI_HandleGetServer()
      - OCI_HandleGetError()
      - OCI_HandleGetSession()
      - OCI_HandleGetTransaction()
      - OCI_HandleGetStatement()
      - OCI_HandleGetLob()
      - OCI_HandleGetFile()
      - OCI_HandleGetDate()
      - OCI_HandleGetTimestamp()
      - OCI_HandleGetInterval()
      - OCI_HandleGetObject() 

    * Extended Hash Tables support :

      - See updated example in the documentation (page <module>, section <Hash tables>)
      - Added OCI_HashGetEntry() to browse an OCILIB Hash Tables
      - Added OCI_HashGetType()
      - Added OCI_HashGetSize()
 
    * Added support for Lobs larger > 4 Go (Oracle 10g)

      - See updated section in the documentation (page <module>, section <Internal Large Objects (LOBs)>)
      - Added type lobsize_t (unsigned int or unsigned long long depending platform and compiler)
      - Modified OCI_Lob and OCI_File APIs to change lob size and offset type from unsigned int to lobsize_t 
        
    * Extended Oracle versions support

      - Added OCI_GetVersionConnection()
      - Building OCILIB with versions of Oracle < 10g and OCI_IMPORT_LINKAGE option could fail because :

        * BINARY FLOAT and BINARY DOUBLE (introduced in 10g) type references were not excluded from 8i and 9i builds
        * Some Timestamp and Interval (introduced in 9i) code portions were not excluded from 8i builds

      - Modified Oracle version detection
      - Rewritten conditional code compilation directives for handling correctly all versions of Oracle (8i -> 11g)
      - The library has been through series of tests on the following environments:

          * Servers : 10.2.0.1.0,  8.1.7.0.0           
          * Clients : 11.1.0.6.0, 10.2.0.1.0, 9.2.0.1.0, 9.0.1.0.1

      - few errors were encountered but always linked to Oracle known bugs identified on Metalink : nclobs on 8i, intervals on 9i, Full Unicode handling on 9i
      - Known issues that are currently being investigated: 

        * Oracle 8i only + "mixed charset" build : read/write on a CLOB fetched from a "return into" inserts '\0' between characters (looks like double unicode expansion..)

    * Modified Error handling

      - Added OCI_ErrorGetType()
      - Removed error messages prefixes "(OCI_xxx) - "
 
    * Fixed :

      - OCI_RegisterDate() caused OCI_Execute() to crash with Oracle < 10g. It's a known Oracle bug (metalink id #3269146 : OCIBindDynamic() with SQL_ODT).
      - OCI_RegisterDate() works nows on version < 10g (using SQLT_ODT for 10g and SQLT_DAT for 8i and 9i)
      - OCI_LobAppendLob() caused an ORA-24805 on Oracle 8.1.x only
      - OCI_xxxxToText() functions now initialize output buffers even on failure
