>"About Ocilib, i am working in Telecom Italia S.p.A. and we are using your Ocilib library compiled on HP Itanium System in our Interconnection System in Brazil. In a process to extract daily traffic data from partitioned oracle tables, about 30.000.000 records for each day. This process wrote to use dynamic sql 4 Method had a big performance problem and i have sponsored your ocilib and we have improved +60% performance. I am using your ocilib also in a windows desktop application on XP system, with good results. Thanks Vincent."

>"I have been asked to replay 90 minutes of captured SQL code back into a database. The oracle database is one of the largest in the southern hemisphere apparently [....] 90 minutes of captured data is about 2 terabytes of information [...] The replay is all happening on a single client Solaris 64 bit machine [...] From a parent controlling process I spawn 1300 client processes that each connect to the database[...]"
>all calls seems to happen very, very quickly and that, in my opinion, a significant reason the project is succeeding is due to your library and your commitment to quality code.
>Thank you! Well Done! Bravo!
>The system I have written has been designed to really hammer the database and your code stands up very well.

>First of all, I would like to say that I'm really impressed with OCILIB.  I have written myself a set wrapper functions similar to OCILIB that I have used for years, but have started using yours since you're much farther along than I am.
