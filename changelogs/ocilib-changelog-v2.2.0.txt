2008-03-19 Version 2.2.0 Vincent Rogier vince.rogier@gmail.com

    * Public interface

      - Added OCI_SetPrefetchMemory() (see documentation)
      - Added OCI_GetPrefetchMemory()
      - Added OCI_SetPassword()
      - Added OCI_Break()
      - See new section in the documentation (page <module>, section <Aborting long operations>)
      - Modified few functions prototypes with no parameters -> from f() to f(void) for strict ansi C support 
      - Added 'const' qualifier to nearly all string parameter and string return values

    * Extended OCI_GetString() :

      - Modified : Implicit conversion from double uses now '%f' instead of '%g'.
      - Added support for OCI_Timestamp, OCI_Interval and implicit conversion

    * Fixes

      - Memory leak : If a statement that has returned a resulset is re-executed directly with OCI_Execute() (without any parse step), the previous resultset was not freed
      - Some statements attributes (fetch size, pre-fetched size, bind mode, long mode, long size) where reinitialized at every SQL parsing. Now they are persistent.
      - Constants OCI_FETCH_SIZE, OCI_PREFETCH_SIZE values were set to Oracle default values and were not assigned at statement creation time.
        So, if the library was rebuilt with different values, the modified values where not applied! Now, theses attributes are internally set internally when a statement is created
      - Now server version is initialized when the connection object is created (some tests for some features support could failed)

    * Modifications

      - Added support for OS authentification by passing NULL user and NULL password to OCI_CreateConnection()
      - Modified default date format for implicit conversion (DD/MM/YYYY -> YYYY-MM-DD)
      - Modified OCI_BindXX() calls : if bind mode is OCI_BIND_POS, the position used is now the given bind name (:1, :2, ...) instead of the internal bind object index
      - Modified OCI_CreateConnection() : it returns now NULL id OCI_Initialize() has not been called
      - Reintroduced support for native C++ compilation of OCILIB

    * Miscellaneous

      - Validation of LabWindow/LabView compilers
      - change email -> vince.rogier@gmail.com
      - Modified demo application: tests are now grouped in series of functions
      - Object support in Unicode builds : Oracle confirmed the bug when setting objects attributes (bug #6885036 on Metalink)
