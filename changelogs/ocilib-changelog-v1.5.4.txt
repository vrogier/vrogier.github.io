    * Miscellaneous modifications and fixes

      - Added    : OCI_REVISION_VERSION constant
      - Fixed    : Statement handle on a statement bind call() was allocated again and not always freed and could

      - Fixed    : OCI_Date * Array binding : wrong memory allocation size
      - Fixed    : Strings Array binding didn't adjust the buffer size depending on the sizeof(dtext) and could

      - Fixed    : OCI_Long * Type (CLONG or BLONG) was wrongly set
      - Modified : Refactoring of internal datatypes allocation, binding and defining for better performances, 
                  more comptact and safer code

      - Modified : Extended demo application with array binding support, ref cursor, nested tables, 
                  timestamps and intervals
