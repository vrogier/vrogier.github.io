2008-01-28 Version 1.6.0 Vincent Rogier vince_rogier@yahoo.fr
 
    * Extended Oracle version information

      - OCI_GetServerMajorVersion()    
      - OCI_GetServerMinorVersion()    
      - OCI_GetServerRevisionVersion()    

    * Added support for "SQL returning clause"

      - OCI_GetNextResultset()
      - OCI_RegisterInt()    
      - OCI_RegisterString() 
      - OCI_RegisterRaw()   
      - OCI_RegisterDouble()    
      - OCI_RegisterDate()    
      - OCI_RegisterLob()    
      - OCI_RegisterFile()    
      - OCI_RegisterTimestamp()    
      - OCI_RegisterInterval()  
   
    * Miscellaneous added functions

      - OCI_BindArrayGetSize()
      - OCI_GetColumnCharUsed() 
      - OCI_SchemaGetTableName()

    * Important modifications

      - OCI_BindString() and OCI_BindArrayOfStrings() : the parameter len which is the max length of the buffer
       (or array element) is NOW :
            
        * UNDERSTOOD WITHOUT the zero terminal terminator.
        * EXPRESSED in CHARACTERS

      - So, for OCI_BindString() :

        * if the string is char    str[31], pass 30 as len instead of 31 in earlier version
        * if the string is wchar_t str[31], pass 30 as len instead of 62 in earlier version

      - So, for OCI_BindArrayOfStrings() :

        * if the string is char    str[10][31], pass 30 as len instead of 31 in earlier version
        * if the string is wchar_t str[10][31], pass 30 as len instead of 62 in earlier version

      - OCI_GetColumnSize() : return the size in characters for string column created with the qualifier CHAR for
        indicating the size in character and not in bytes

      - Prototypes for OCI_BindArrayOfInts(), OCI_BindArrayOfDoubles(), OCI_BindArrayOfStrings() changed :

        * For scalar C types (int, double and char*), the 'data' parameter was changed from type** to type* in
          order to avoid compiler warnings and casts

    * Miscellaneous modifications

      - Updated documentation (returning features and rowids, ...)
      - Extended source code comments
      - OCI_IsNull() was returning FALSE with a NULL handle, now returns TRUE
      - Added few cast and corrected few variable cast to compile nicely with highest warning level (on MS VS2005)
      - Some static were missing from internal function prototypes declaration
      - OCI_FreeResultset() => removed from public interface
      - Updated input parameter checking macros return values of few functions
      - OCI_SchemaGetTable() -> input parameter checking was missing
      - Updated demo application to make it fully portable (charset and platform)
      - Added comments on internal structure members
      - Call to OCI_GetXXXX2() : added checking on the internal map object allocation on failure
      - OCI_BindRaw() : now returns FALSE if len <= 0
      - OCI_ALLOC() : removed type casting
 
    * Miscellaneous fixes

      - OCI_Immediate() and OCI_ImmediateFmt()  : timestamp and interval params ARE STILL NOT parsed from 
       formatted query
      - Some NUMBER columns were wrongly mapped to C int type instead of double
      - OCI_Long internal structure could not be freed for an standalone instance
      - Demo application for handling string in unicode and mixed mode
      - OCI_LobErase : added size checking (oracle error with size = 0 on an empty lob)
      - OCI_BindArrayOfStrings : the allocated size was done with sizeof(mtext) instead of sizeof(dtext)
