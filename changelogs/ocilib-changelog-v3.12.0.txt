2013-02-07 Version 3.12.0 Vincent Rogier vince.rogier@ocilib.net

    * Added support for lob prefetching introduced in 11gR1
    
       - Added OCI_GetDefaultLobPrefetchSize()
       - Added OCI_SetDefaultLobPrefetchSize()
       
    * Enhanced Direct Path API  
    
       - Added OCI_DirPathSetConvertMode() that gives the ability to force direct path conversions
       - Modified OCI_DirPathGetErrorRow() and OCI_DirPathGetErrorColumn() behavior that can return all erred rows/columns after a conversion or load operation
       - Added direct path demo file dirpath_complete.c
       - Updated documentation
       
     * Fixed Direct Path API  
      
       - Fixed direct path logic when stream buffer are too small (OCI_DirPathConvert() returning OCI_DRP_FULL)
       - Fixed direct path logic when conversion and loading errors occur
       - Fixed OCI_DirPathConvert() that support now resuming conversion when an error occurs by fixing values and calling OCI_DirPathConvert() again in default mode (in previous releases duplicated rows were inserted in database)
       - Fixed OCI_DirPathGetErrorRow() and OCI_DirPathGetErrorColumn() that returned zero based row/column indexes instead of being 1 based row/column indexes 
       - Fixed OCI_DirPathSetEntry() : Setting NULL values on column that had decimal/date format throwed an Oracle error
    
    * Fixed Oracle Streams AQ (Advanced Queues) asynchrounous notifications :
    
       - Fixed possible race condition in OCI_DequeueSubscribe() that could cause to have the internal callback called before the user callback was assigned to the dequeue object
       
    * Fixed numeric/ string conversions :

       - Fixed OCI_GetInt(), OCI_GetShort(), OCI_GetBigInt() and unsigned versions when the column type was string based (bug in string/number conversion introduced in v3.11.0)

    * Miscellaneous fixes :   

       - Fixed wrong column buffer size computation for strings, rowids and longs when using OCI_CHARSET_WIDE or OCI_CHARSET_MIXED on unixes platforms
