2008-10-17 Version 3.0.1 Vincent Rogier vince.rogier@gmail.com

    * Miscellaneous fixes

      - Added checks (OCI_ERR_MIN_VALUE) on len parameter (len >=1) of OCI_LobRead(), OCI_LobApend(), OCI_LobWrite(), OCI_FileRead()
      - Compilation of ocilib source with MSCV6++ was broken (vsnprintf was not defined to _vsnprintf anymore)
      - Memory leak : internal bind data allocated for handling PL/SQL tables was never freed 
      - Memory leak : internal OCI_Elem object used by OCI_Coll was never freed
      - Memory leak : since v3.0.0,  OCI_Statement internal stored SQL command string was not freed anymore
      - Scrollable cursors : executing a non select query on a scrollable statement was causing an oracle error

    * The library has been re-tested with various test suites under valgrind to check memory handling and it is now clean !
