2011-12-05 Version 3.9.3 Vincent Rogier vince.rogier@ocilib.net

    * Miscellaneous fixes

      - Fixed broken support for Oracle 8i client since v3.9.0
      - Fixed OCI_ObjectSetObject() : a bug had been introduced in v3.8.1 when computing internal object structure offsets and paddings 
      - Fixed OCI_LobRead(), OCI_LobRead2() : in OCI_CHARSET_WIDE charset builds only, a segfault could happen caused by an internal buffer overwrite    
      - Fixed OCI_SetStatementCacheSize(), OCI_GetStatementCacheSize() : an error ORA-24315 (with no incidence) could be thrown by some versions of Oracle clients
      - Fixed OCI_BindXXX() : All binding methods returned TRUE instead of FALSE when an exception OCI_ERR_MAX_BIND occured
      - Fixed OCI_GetString() : an error OCI-22061 was happening when the column was numeric and a user defined numeric format where provided with OCI_SetDefaultFormatNumeric()
      - Fixed OCI_GetServerRevisionVersion() : it was returned the same value as OCI_GetServerMajorVersion() since v3.4.0
      - Fixed internal method OCI_ParseSqlFmt() used in OCI_xxxFmt() calls : Quoted strings were not properly output since v3.9.0
      - Fixed internal allocation mode : 

          - some OCI_BindXXX() calls were not compatible with OCI_BAM_INTERNAL allocation mode and when used with it, were causing segfaults if the host variable parameter was NULL
          - now these methods raise an OCI_ERR_NULL_POINTER error if the host variable parameter is NULL and the statement bind allocation mode is set to OCI_BAM_INTERNAL

    * Miscellaneous changes

      - OCILIB library compilation

         - Updated Bind allocation mode description : added list of incompatible OCI_BindXXX() methods
         - Added OCI_BAM_INTERNAL compatibility information in all OCI_BindXXX calls() documentation

     - few code internal minor changes
