Hi all,

OCILIB had a well featured documentation but no real user guide/manual.

So, i've worked on it the last few weeks and now [the manual is online and available for download.](https://sourceforge.net/projects/orclib/files/OCILIB%20Guides/ocilib-3.5.0-user-guide.pdf/download)

it covers most of OCILIB features with lots of code examples.

Don't hesitate to let me know any problems with the English syntax as it is not my primary language !

I hope it will be helpful :)

Vincent
