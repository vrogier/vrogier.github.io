OCILIB is a fast and easy driver for accessing Oracle databases in C.

It's designed to be used in Oracle dedicated C/C++ application on Windows and all Unixes systems supported by Oracle.

OCILIB popularity is growing and OCILIB is more and more used for implementing Oracle database access in generic database layers in C, C++ and other languages.

Many people implement their own generic database layers for their products / applications suite to be compatible with different database servers. 

People switch to OCILIB for implementing Oracle access in their generic database layer because :



	
  * they implementing it for the first time and find OCILIB really easy to use and powerful

	
  * they are not satisfied by the performances or the portability of their actual Oracle driver (OBDC, ..) and find OCILIB much better and faster !



Have a nice day !
