The current development snapshot of v3.1.0 has been updated.

You can browse the repository on sourceforge [here](http://orclib.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/orclib/)
The temporary v3.1.0 changelog is available [here](http://orclib.sourceforge.net/public/changelogs/ocilib-changelog-v3.1.0.txt)

New in this v3.1.0 development snapshot update : 




  * Oracle Ref datatype support


  * Exented Objects And Collection Elements support


  * Added some tracing features


  * Miscelleanous changes and fixes



This update is really close the final release (might add subscriptions limited to DCN features ?).

On non Windows platforms, be sure to call ./reconf before any ./configure... 

Have a nice day
