Hi all,

OCILIB 4.0 is coming soon ! 

As i mentioned earlier on, this new version introduces a brand new C++ API on top of the OCILIB C API. ([see my previous post here](http://orclib.sourceforge.net/2013/06/ocilib-c-api-coming-soon/)).
There are also some minor enhancement in the C API.
I'm still (!!) working on the C++ documentation and fixing final details in the C++ API.

Version 4.0 should be released in October 2013 !
