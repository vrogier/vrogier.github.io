OCILIB name has been updated for the release of version 3.0.0 !
  

OCILIB (C Wrapper for Oracle OCI) is now **OCILIB - C Driver for Oracle**.
The old name was not really clear for non Oracle fans ! So I decided to change the library short description for a more direct and easy one.
  

OCILIB runs on all Oracle platforms and can be used by any language that support C binding.
Version 3.0.0 will be available by next monday (October, 13th).
  

I'd like to thank all people that have spent time on testing this major release :-)
