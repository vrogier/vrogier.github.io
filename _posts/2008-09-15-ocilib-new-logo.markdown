Good News !

OCILIB has got now a brand new logo for the upcoming version 3.0.0 and I hope you'll like it :

On my spare time, I'm the leader of the Oracle team at developpez.com, the leading online web magazine and community for Developper's in French. 

My colleague from the TeX / LaTeX team (nickname "abecrow") designed this logo and redone the ocilib website header. He made a great job !

This logo is simple, clean and nice. It's exactly what I was expecting for OCILIB.

I really do like it  :-))
