Hi all,

I finally found time for testing OCILIB against Oracle 12c R1 :)

As expected, no problems were found and I've added compile and runtime detection of OCI 12cR1.
For the release 4.0.0, some new OCI features introduced in 12cR1 will be supported.

Other ones will be reserved for the release 4.1.0 !
