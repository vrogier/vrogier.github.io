Hi all,

OCILIB first version has been released in October 2007 and has now been downloaded more than 27,000 times (about 24.000 downloads on SourceForge and 3.000 from others sources handled by Google Analytics).

Nearly 30.000 download in 3 years, that's great :)

OCILIB is a now mature, is the most complete OCI wrapper.

A big thank you for all of you that helped me to make it better and safer.

Just a little request  : OCILIB is free, open source and widely used in application. Some people reported their usage of OCILIB. Please feel free to send me a mail with some information about your own usage of OCILIB :)

Have a nice day !
