A new OCILIB release is available !

Content :



	
  * Added support for PL/SQL tables (PL/SQL arrays)Â  when binding C (native and OCILIB types arrays) to PL/SQL block

	
  * Extended Date, timestamp and interval support : few more functions, added conversion to ISO C time datatypes and now these types can be created independtly from database connections

	
  * Extended OCI_Connection handle attributes : alive status and association of program user data

	
  * Added Support for retreiving server output : calls to dbms_output.put() and dbms_output.put_line() from inside PL/SQL blocks, triggers, procedures, packages, .. can be now retreived by OCILIB

	
  * Added Support for OCI Threadkeys : you can now have a process wide name identifier (key) that can have hold thread specific values (a bit like a getenv() and putenv() but values are stored by thread)

	
  * Extended runtime loading of Oracle shared libs on various Unix-like systems : some exotic sharted lib names (dylib, sh, ...) are now handled by the configure script and also managed for runtime time loading of Oracle shared libs

	
  * Added Support for Oracle Instant Client on Unix-like systems : 2 options have been added to the configure script in order to handle Instant Client packages correctly (differents packages for headers and libs + paths are different from regular clients)

	
  * Extended OCILIB documentation : added an installation page for all platforms and all examples have been checked out and extended to full C program source code

	
  * Added more demo source code : now, about 25 example source code ready to compile are provided
